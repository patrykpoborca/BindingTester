# BindingTester

This just a small little code sample of how the new feature "binding" works.

Things that I've seen so far (if you're from google)

1) BR sometimes doesn't generate despite other things working

2) EditText doesn't work very well with binding. The cursor gets stuck at the start of the edittext (thus me writing a small custom one)
